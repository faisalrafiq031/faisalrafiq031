I'm a backend-focused developer with full-stack potential specialize in automating workflows and extracting actionable insights from complex datasets using Python, Selenium, and BeautifulSoup. Currently expanding my expertise in data engineering, big data pipelines, and the Django framework, I transform raw data into meaningful visualizations and reports, solving real-world problems with precision.

 <summary><h3>👨‍💻 Faisal's Coding Journey</h3></summary>
   I started learning to code as a student in 2020, beginning with HTML, then CSS, and basic JavaScript. During this time, I built several basic-level frontend projects, including a weather app, YouTube clone, Netflix clone, and LMS clone, which gave me a strong foundation in web development.

As a computer science student, I also dabbled in C and C++ basics, further deepening my understanding of programming fundamentals.

In 2024, my journey took a new direction as I started learning Python scripting. I quickly dived into web scraping and began exploring tools and technologies like Docker, Airflow, Apache Spark, MSSQL, Power BI, Matplotlib, and Streamlit, integrating these skills to create end-to-end solutions with MSSQL.

Now, I’ve set my sights on mastering the Django framework, expanding my capabilities in web application development. My journey is far from over, but each step has brought me closer to becoming the developer I aspire to be. The best is yet to come.
